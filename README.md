# ShooterOOM
A 2-D mimic of a shooter game using JARs
We consider the game to be a 2-D one. 
The players are spread across the map and can move by one step in any of the 4 possible directions at a time
Difference between mid sem architecture and present one:Strategy and logic weren't written down in the mid sem class diagram. Everything else remains the same.
